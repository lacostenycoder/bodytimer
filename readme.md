## Overview

**Body Timer**, based on the workout program for the *Body For Life*.


#### Instructions 

The cardio program recommends increasing intensity in a step sequence over
a period of 20 minutes.  The level of intensity should be on scale of 1 - 10.
You go up intensity starting with a 2 min warm-up at level 5, then increments up
from 6,7,8,9 then drop back down to 6.  The 9s are considered "high points" where you should be giving it almost all you've got.  Then the last high point you push the very max at 10 for the list minute.  That's really all there is to it.

#### Reson for Making This App.

While that patern seems simple enough, it's kind of hard to keep track of if your on a treadmill or machine at a gym where they normally count backward from whatever you time set its.  So it gets even harder to keep track of.  This simple little timer will "coach" you by showing youw what level you should be at.  I've added speech api for voice cues so you don't need to stair at the thing and probably could listen to music and you'll be queued when to go to the next level!

### Todo's 

- Write test coverage and test all devices.
This should work on any device but have not tested successfully if the voice api works on IOS.  Works on my android device using default Chrome browser.
- Add some better design and perhaps more vocal coahing.
-Add user accounts to track progress over time.

- Add graphics to show current levels and cycles left.
